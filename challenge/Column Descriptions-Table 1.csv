Column Name,Description,,,
MapMySectionsID,"A unique, anonymized identifier for each experiment. These identifiers will be linked to actual experiment identifiers in the Genetics Tools Atlas at the conclusion of the challenge",,,
Genetics Tools Type,Either “Enhancer AAV” or “Mouse transgenic line” to indicating the underlying type of genetic tool. Note that the training and test data sets each include some enhancer AAVs and some mouse transgenic lines.,,,
STPT Data File Path,Link to the image series in OME-Zarr format. This is the primary data required for the challenge. See Data Challenge page for resources showing how to access and use these data.,,,
STPT Thumbnail Image,Link to a small thumbnail image of one section of the genetic tool that intersects VISp for quick viewing. These are potentially useful as a sanity check of algorithm results or for inclusion in user-created tools.,,,
Neuroglancer File Path,Link to same data for visualization using Neuroglancer. See Data Challenge page for resources showing how to use Neuroglancer.,,,
CCF Registered Image File Path,Link to zip file containing quantified intensities of red and green channels for each 25um CCF voxel in the STPT image series.  See Data Challenge page for resources showing how to access and use these data.,,,
Target_Cell_Population,Cell populations targeted with this experiment. Note: This is not necessarily the cell populations actually identified!,,,
Qualitative Image Assessment,"Sets of comma-separated qualitative assessments for labeling strength, labeling density, and labeled cell populations made based on review of epifluorescence image data for the same genetic tool. In cases where more than one assessment is included, cells from all of the listed types were labeled. While these calls do not constitute quantitative validation, they are likely to reflect actual cell type assignments in cases when SMART-Seq v4 data is missing. Note that a value of ""Neuron"" indicates that the specific neuronal populations targeted could not be accurately assessed in that experiment.",,,
(Quantitative Cell Type Assignments),"The remaining columns reflect quantitative cell type information from up to 48 cells from a given genetic tool collected using SMART-Seq v4 and aligned to whole mouse brain cell types from the Allen Brain Atlas at the ""subclass"" level of the hierarchy. These columns represent the ground truth data to be targeted by computational algorithms.  Numbers in these columns represent the count of cells from a given experiment that mapped to the corresponding subclass.",,,
